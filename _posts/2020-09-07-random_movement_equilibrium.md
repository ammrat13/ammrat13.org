In my [last post]({{page.previous.url}}), I touched on my efforts to model how a
simple "virus" moves through a population, mainly through the lens of
differential equations. As part of that, I wanted to test my model of how the
population moves over time. Intuitively, we'd expect the dynamics to follow the
[Diffusion Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_equation), which
reduces to the [Heat Equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heat_equation) if
the diffusivity is constant throught the domain.

Imagine my surprise, then, when I simulated the population to a steady state and
got the above distribution. It's inconsistent with the heat equation --- we'd be
expecting a uniform equilibrium distribution from that. Instead, we get "clumps"
on the edges of the simulation domain, as well as "rarefactions" near them.

Granted, the result makes sense. Look at the code that moves people around:
{% highlight python %}
dx = np.random.normal(scale=MOVE_SIGMA, size=(POP_SIZE,))
population += dx
population = np.clip(population, 0.0, 1.0)
{% endhighlight %}
A given person has a non-zero probability of winding up exactly on the boundary,
unlike everywhere else in the domain. Really, the bounaries are accumulating
everyone who overstepped them.

The rarefactions are somewhat harder to explain. The best I can come up with is
to compare it to the "unbounded" case. Imagine if the simulation domain
streteched to infinity in both directions. Then, with every person moving
according to a normal distribution, having a constant population density would
be an equilibrium state. When we bound the domain, however, we lose the
contribution of everyone outside. This becomes especially noticible near the
edges, where almost half of the influx would be coming from outside @@[0,1]@@.

Of couse, I find these "clipping artifacts" undesireable, and I looked for ways
to mitigate them. One idea I had was to reroll the positions of people who
overstepped instead of simply clipping them to the edge.
{% highlight python %}
dx = np.random.normal(scale=MOVE_SIGMA, size=(POP_SIZE,))
while True:
    population += dx
    outIdx = (population <= 0.0) | (population >= 1.0)
    numOut = np.sum(outIdx)
    if numOut != 0:
        population[outIdx] -= dx[outIdx]
        dx[~outIdx] = 0.0
        dx[outIdx] = np.random.normal(scale=MOVE_SIGMA, size=(numOut,))
    else:
        break
{% endhighlight %}
This did get rid of the people clumped to the edge, but it still left the
rarefactions. In fact, it actually made them much worse.

On a side note, decreasing the variance for people's movement seemed to help
significantly. In my simulation, all the people moved according to a normal
distribution, and the above figures were collected with @@\texttt{MOVE_SIGMA} =
\sigma = 0.1@@. This value can be made arbitrarily small --- if, every second,
people move according to a normal distribution with variance @@\sigma^2@@,
simply do @@n@@ "runs" with variance @@\frac{1}{n}\sigma^2@@ to simulate one
second, where @@n@@ can be made arbitrarily large.

That works in theory, but not in practice. If we have a population of size
@@\texttt{POP_SIZE} = K@@ and we simulate for @@t@@ seconds, then simulating
takes @@\mathcal{O}(ntK)@@ time. That's not great, especially since two of those
parameters are being made really large. However, we only really want to see the
equilibrium state for now, and it might be better to calculate it rather than to
simulate it out.

To do this, we can start by formalizing the problem we are trying to solve. I'll
consider the case where we clip the people to the edges of the domain, and the
case where we reroll can be built on top of it. We can specify the state of our
system with a number @@\rho_{\text{side}}@@, specifying the proportion of people
clipped to one side, as well as a function @@\rho: [0,1] \to \mathbb{R}^+@@,
specifying the density of people at a particular location. The system proceeds
by computing
%%\begin{align\*}
\rho_{\text{side}} &:=
    \frac{\rho_{\text{side}}}{2} +
    \frac{\rho_{\text{side}}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \int_{-\infty}^{-1} e^{-\frac{t^2}{2\sigma^2}}\,dt +
    \int_0^1 \int_{-\infty}^{0} \frac{\rho(x)}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(t-x)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \, dt \, dx \nl
\rho(x) &:=
    \frac{\rho_{\text{side}}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{x^2}{2\sigma^2}} +
    \frac{\rho_{\text{side}}}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-1)^2}{2\sigma^2}} +
    \int_0^1 \frac{\rho(t)}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}}e^{\frac{(x-t)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \, dt .
\end{align\*}%%
The first term is the contribution from the left "wall", the second term that
from the right wall, and the third term that from everywhere else. This
iteration is quite complicated, and I highly doubt there is a closed form
expression for the fixed points.

So, we approximate. We can discretize the domain into @@\texttt{NUM_BINS} = N@@
regions of equal length @@\texttt{BIN_DELTA} = \Delta@@, treating the two walls
separately, and create a Markov matrix @@\texttt{markovMat} = \mathbf{M}@@ for
movement between the regions. For calculation, we'll say that the population
density is constant throught a given region. As for indexing, let index @@0@@ be
the left wall, index @@N+1@@ the right wall, and each of the "bins" indexed left
to right starting at @@1@@. Also, we'll use left stochastic matrices because
that's what `numpy` seems to play better with --- @@M_{j,i}@@ represents the
probability of transitioning to state @@j@@ given you are in state @@i@@.

We can then go through the caclulations. First, we take care of transitioning
between walls:
%%\begin{align\*}
M_{0,0} = M_{N+1,N+1} &= \frac{1}{2} \nl
M_{N+1,0} = M_{0,N+1} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \int_{-\infty}^{-1} e^{-\frac{t^2}{2\sigma^2}} \, dt.
\end{align\*}%%
Now, consider transitioning between a wall and a bin @@B@@, and vice versa:
%%\begin{align\*}
M_{B,0} = M_{N+1-B,N+1} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \int_{(B-1)\Delta}^{B\Delta} e^{-\frac{t^2}{2\sigma^2}} \, dt\nl
M_{0,B} = M_{N+1,N+1-B} &= \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \int_{(B-1)\Delta}^{B\Delta} \int_{-\infty}^0 e^{-\frac{(t-x)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \, dt \, dx.
\end{align\*}%%
Finally, consider transitioning from a bin @@b@@ to another bin @@B@@:
%% M_{B,b} = \frac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} \int_{(b-1)\Delta}^{b\Delta} \int_{(B-1)\Delta}^{B\Delta} e^{-\frac{(t-x)^2}{2\sigma^2}} \, dt \, dx. %%

The above formulas aren't nice. Far from it. But, they are computable. We can
even get a "closed-form" solution using the error function @@\text{erf}@@,
implemented in Python as `math.erf`. We can use the formulas above to populate
@@\mathbf{M}@@, from where we can solve for an eigenvector with eigenvalue one
by computing @@(\mathbf{M} - \mathbf{I})\mathbf{v} = \mathbf{0}@@. In fact,
since @@\texttt{solMat} = \mathbf{M} - \mathbf{I}@@ is not full rank, we can
replace one of the rows with another constraint to get a particular
@@\mathbf{v}@@. For instance, I required the numbers in the vector to sum to a
particular value, corresponding to a fixed population size.
{% highlight python %}
solMat[-1] = np.ones((markovMatSize,))
solVec[-1] = POP_SIZE
sol = np.linalg.solve(solMat, solVec)
{% endhighlight %}
This algorithm is @@\mathcal{O}(N^3)@@, which was much faster than simulating
for me. It was just a question of how well it worked.

![The result of the Markov chain, compared to simulation](/assets/2020/09/07/clip_filter_expected.png)
It worked pretty well. The above figure is the output of the Markov chain (in
orange) compared to simulating until equilibrium (in blue). It was done with
clipping, with @@\sigma = 0.1@@, and with @@N = 100@@. The outputs inside the
simulation domain are fairly close, and numbers of people clipped (not shown on
the graph above to avoid clutter) differ by only @@0.3\%@@.

What I've said so far only applies to the case where we clip people to the
boundaries. Thankfully, rerolls are just a small extension to this. We simply
compute @@\mathbf{M}@@ as described above, neglect the cases where a person goes
into or comes out of a "wall," then renormalize all the probabilities to sum to
one.
{% highlight python %}
markovMat = np.delete(markovMat, [0,-1], axis=0)
markovMat = np.delete(markovMat, [0,-1], axis=1)
markovMat /= np.sum(markovMat, axis=0)
{% endhighlight %}

![The results with rerolls](/assets/2020/09/07/reroll_expected.png)
Again, it works fairly well. Of course, my work here is far from perfect, and
there's probably still a lot more that can be done to refine the model. For
instance, you might notice that the Markov chain seems to overestimate the
number of people around the edges. Why is that? I invite you all to take a look
at the code and see what you can find.
