My family came over for my sister's graduation, so I chose to spend time with
them instead of competing in the 2022 DEF CON CTF Qualifiers. Still, I briefly
looked over the challenges, and I later solved this "mic test" problem.

Most teams solved this challenge by brute-force, which is surprisingly the
[intended solution][1]. I can guess that this method "randomly" samples the
possible checksums, taking @@2^{32}@@ tries to find a solution on average. This
hunch is confirmed by all the example answers having six extra characters, where
@@n=6@@ is the smallest integer satisfying @@62^n \geq 2^{32}@@. Finding a
solution using fewer letters is possible but unlikely --- @@21.7\%@@ probability
at most.

However, there is another approach that leverages the properties of a Cyclic
Redundancy Check (CRC). It is guaranteed to find a solution, and it does so much
faster than the straightforward but exponential method.


## Introduction

### How CRCs Work

First, it's necessary to understand some of the math underlying CRCs.
Ultimately, the goal of any checksum is to take in some data and derive from it
a "check value" of a fixed length --- 32-bit in our case. They just have to
withstand random mutations, not adversarial changes to the input. As such, these
algorithms can (and should) be simpler than hashes. They should be
mathematically nice to ease reasoning about how they respond to different
classes of errors and how those responses may be used to recover the original
data from the corrupted copy.

In the specific case of CRCs, they treat each bit as an element of @@\FF_2@@: an
element of @@\\{0,1\\}@@ where addition is XOR and multiplication is AND. This
definition was chosen to make @@\FF_2@@ a *field*, a set where the usual
operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division) are defined and
behave the way you'd expect with regular numbers. To represent bitstrings, CRCs
work over @@\FF_2[x]@@: the ring of polynomials with coefficients in @@\FF_2@@,
with polynomial addition and multiplication defined in the usual way. For
example, the string `1010` is represented as the polynomial @@x^3 + x@@, where
@@x@@ is just a formal symbol not representing any underlying value. Again, this
choice was made to make CRCs easy to reason about mathematically. Polynomials
are some of the nicest objects out there, but they have just enough depth to
admit sophisticated algorithms.

To calculate the checksum, CRCs reduce the bitstream's polynomial with respect
to some modulus. For CRC-32, the modulus is
%%\begin{align\*}
    \pi =&\,
        1 + x + x^2 + x^4  + x^5 \nl
        &+ x^7 + x^8 + x^{10} + x^{11} \nl
        &+ x^{12} + x^{16} + x^{22} + x^{23} \nl
        &+ x^{26} + x^{32},
\end{align\*}%%
the symbol @@\pi@@ of course standing for πolynomial. You can construct the
message's polynomial and then take the remainder by polynomial long division,
but it's more economical to do the reduction after each operation. Effectively,
you work over @@\FF_2[x] / \langle\pi\rangle@@: the space of polynomials but you
treat those that differ by some multiple of @@\pi@@ as equal. Again, long
division can take any element to its "canonical" form.

That's CRCs in a nutshell. Treat your data as a polynomial @@p \in \FF_2[x] /
\langle\pi\rangle@@ and reduce it to its canonical form by polynomial long
division. Implementation is a bit more complicated than that, of course. For
instance, you actually reduce @@p \cdot x^{32}@@. That way, you can just append
the checksum to the message when sending it, and the check passes if the
recieved data is congruent to zero modulo @@\pi@@. Additionally, some
implementations perform superficial changes to the data. Some NOT the output.
Some reflect the output's bits (so bit 31 maps to bit 0, 30 to 1, ...). Some
reflect the bits of each individual input byte.

Most importantly, many implementations use a table-driven approach, computing
one byte at a time instead of just one bit. Exploring that is worth an entire
post, but the upshot is that it's only equivalent to this method when the
algorithm is seeded with zero. Some implementations seed it with `0xffffffff`
instead, which has the effect of NOTing the first 32 bits of the input.
Equivalently, it prepends
%%\begin{equation\*}
    \frac{1}{x^{32}} \cdot \left( \sum_{i=0}^{31} x^i \right)
\end{equation\*}%%
to the message. In general, if the table method is seeded with @@p@@, it XORs
that with the first 32 bits of the input, or it equivalently prepends @@p \cdot
x^{-32}@@.

### The Choice of π

It's worth noting some properties of CRC-32's choice of @@\pi@@. That polynomial
is *irreducible* over @@\FF_2@@, meaning it can't be factored any further
without introducing numbers other than @@\\{0,1\\}@@. A nice result of this
choice is that @@\FF_{2^{32}} = \FF_2[x] / \langle\pi\rangle@@ is itself a
field. Every element has a multiplicative inverse, and it makes sense to talk
about things like @@x^{-32}@@. The polynomial @@\pi@@ is also *primitive*,
meaning the formal symbol @@x@@ generates the multiplicative group. Taking the
powers of @@x@@ will go over every other element (except zero) before cycling
back to @@x@@. Again, these choices were made to make reasoning about this
structure easier.

The notation @@\FF_{2^{32}}@@ is no accident either. It's a field with exactly
that many elements --- a binary choice for each coefficient from @@x^0@@ to
@@x^{31}@@. It's also *the* field with that many elements, since all of them are
isomorphic. Additionally, all finite fields have prime power sizes, and it's
worth exploring why that is, since the same methods are used in the attack
later.

> *Lemma:* A field @@F@@ can be viewed as a vector space over any of its
> subfields @@K@@.

The required axioms can easily be checked. Those for vector addition are almost
trivially satisfied, as are those for identity and distributivity. The only
important thing to check happens with vector multiplication. We require that
%%\begin{equation\*}
    a \cdot b\vect{v} = (ab) \cdot \vect{v}
\end{equation\*}%%
where @@a,b \in K@@ and @@ab \in K@@. That's why we needed @@K@@ to be a
subfield. □

An easy example is @@\FF_{2^{32}}@@ itself. The elements @@1, x, x^2, \cdots@@
can be thought of as basis "vectors," scaled by either zero or one: an element
of @@\FF_2@@. This line of thinking extends quite well.

> *Theorem (from [MathOverflow][2]):* A finite field @@F@@ has order @@\|F\| =
> p^n@@ for @@p@@ prime.

Consider the additive group generated by @@1@@, so
%%\begin{align\*}
& 0 \nl
& 0 + 1 \nl
& 0 + 1 + 1 \nl
& \cdots.
\end{align\*}%%
It can be checked that these elements form a subfield @@K \subseteq F@@.
Additionally, since @@F@@ is finite, continuting to add ones in this manner will
eventually start to repeat elements, meaning @@K \cong \ZZ/p\ZZ@@. For that to
be a field, @@p@@ must be prime.

By the lemma above @@F@@ is a vector space over @@K@@, and since it's finite,
it's finitely generated. Let @@\\{b\_1, \cdots, b\_n\\}@@ be a
basis, so every linear combination
%%\begin{equation\*}
    \alpha\_1 b\_1 + \cdots + \alpha\_n b\_n
\end{equation\*}%%
gives a unique element of @@F@@. With each @@\alpha@@ in @@K@@, we get @@p@@
possibilities for each coefficient, giving a total of @@p^n@@ different
elements. □

This is not the only proof of this theorem. Another, also from
[MathOverflow][3], uses Bézout's identity to show by contradiction that the
field would have zero divisors otherwise.


## Approach

With all the introductory material out of the way, we can start tackling the
actual problem. As a reminder, we want to find a string that starts with a
specific substring (say `DC`) whose CRC-32 is a particular value. I'll actually
restrict the search space a bit more. I'll look for a string that starts with
`DC` then contains exactly @@\ell@@ characters, each either @@c@@ or @@d@@. Let
@@\delta = d - c@@ and compute @@p@@ the CRC-32 of the original message: `DC`
followed by the character @@c@@ repeated @@\ell@@ times. Of course, this will
likely differ from the target polynomial @@t@@, but we can change the message by
substituting some instances of @@c@@ with @@d@@ --- by adding instances of
@@\delta@@ shifted by the appropriate amount. Intuitively, changing the message
leads to predictable effects on the output --- if you add something to the
input, you just add the same thing to the output. So, we look at the difference
and solve for the required change.

Specifically, we wish to solve for @@\alpha_i \in \FF_2@@ in
%%\begin{equation\*}
    x^{32} \cdot \sum\_{i=0}^{\ell-1} \alpha\_i \cdot x^{8i}\delta = t - p.
\end{equation\*}%%
The @@x^{8i}@@ term in the sum shifts the correction into the right place. For
example, setting @@i=0@@ will shift the correction to the last character in the
string, setting @@i=1@@ will be the second to last, and so on. Choosing
@@\alpha_i=1@@ means to substitute that character into @@d@@, while choosing it
zero means to leave it as @@c@@. The extra shift of @@x^{32}@@ corresponds to
the CRC algorithm multiplying the message by that before taking the remainder.

We can rearrange the above equation to read
%%\begin{equation\*}
    \sum\_{i=0}^{\ell-1} \alpha\_i \cdot \left(x^8\right)^i = \frac{t - p}{x^{32}\delta}.
\end{equation\*}%%
On the LHS we have a linear combination of constant elements, and on the RHS we
have a constant. To solve this, we suddenly remember that this field
@@\FF_{2^{32}}@@ can be expressed as a vector space over a subfield. Taking
@@K=\\{0,1\\}=\FF_2@@ allows us to operate under the standard basis
@@\\{1,x,x^2,\cdots,x^{31}\\}@@. The constants can be rewritten in this basis to
get
%%\begin{align\*}
    \sum\_{i=0}^{\ell-1} \alpha\_i \vect{v}\_i &= \vect{y} \nl
    \matr{V}\vect{\alpha} &= \vect{y},
\end{align\*}%%
where @@\matr{V}@@ is the matrix with column vectors @@\vect{v}\_i = x^{8i}@@.
This system can be easily solved, though not necessarily uniquely, as long as
@@\matr{V}@@'s columns span @@\FF_{2^{32}}@@.


## Failure Resistance

So when does that fail? Clearly, when @@\ell@@ is too small, there aren't enough
vectors for a baisis and thus too few for a spanning set. The least you can
possibly get away with is @@\ell = \dim\FF_{2^{32}} = 32@@. In some cases,
that's also sufficient.

### On "2<sup>*w*</sup>-Periodic" Bases

Specifically, when the attacker can choose to substitute individual words
independently of each other, assuming a word's length is a power of two @@2^w@@,
@@\ell=32@@ is sufficient. This is because going through the above process with
this setup results in the vectors @@\vect{v}\_i@@ being @@x^{2^w i}@@. I'll
prove that this set is a basis iff the set of @@x^i@@ is a basis, which it
obviously is for @@i = 0, \cdots, 31@@.

> *Theorem:* The set @@B = \\{b_0,\cdots,b_{\ell-1}\\}@@ of elements in
> @@\FF_{p^n}@@ spans its field iff the set @@B^p =
> \\{b_0^p,\cdots,b_{\ell-1}^p\\}@@ does.

For the "only if" direction, observe that if @@v@@ can be expressed as a linear
combination of basis elements in @@B@@, then
%%\begin{align\*}
    v^p
        &= \left( \sum\_{i=0}^{\ell-1} \alpha_i b_i \right)^p \nl
        &= \sum\_{i=0}^{\ell-1} \alpha_i^p b_i^p \nl
\end{align\*}%%
by Freshman's Dream. Since the Frobenius endomorphism is bijective over finite
fields, one can make any target vector out of elements of @@B^p@@ by making its
preimage using @@B@@ then raising it to the @@p@@-th power.

For the "if" direction, we use a similar argument. To construct a target element
@@v@@, construct @@v^p@@ using elements of @@B^p@@, then construct @@v@@ by
taking the @@p@@-th root of all the coefficients and using them on the basis
@@B@@. Again, doing this is well defined since the Frobenius endomorphism is
bijective over @@\FF_{p^n}@@. □

> *Corollary:* Same as the above theorem, but with the set @@B^{p^k} =
> \\{b_0^{p^k},\cdots,b_{\ell-1}^{p^k}\\}@@ instead of @@B^p@@, where @@k@@ is
> an arbitrary natural number.

Apply the above theorem @@k@@ times. □

The result we set out to prove is this corollary with @@p=2@@, @@k=w@@, and
@@b_i = x^i@@.

### On *n* Consecutive Powers of Primitive Elements

The result in the previous section was agnostic to our choice of @@b_i@@.
However, our basis is usually quite "nice". For example, in the last section, we
chose the standard basis @@\\{1,x,x^2,\cdots,x^{31}\\}@@. Moreover, since
multiplication by a constant is a linear automorphism, we could have chosen any
32 consecutive powers of @@x@@. These same results hold for some other elements
too.

In particular, it holds for primitive elements of @@\FF_{2^{32}}@@. This fact
could've been used to prove the result in the last section. Unfortunately, it
has limited utility since it requires consecutive powers of that element, which
might be hard to guarantee for non-powers of two.

> *Lemma:* If the minimal polynomial of @@g \in \FF_{p^n}@@ has degree at least
> (so, exactly) @@n@@, then the set @@\\{1,g,g^2,\cdots,g^{n-1}\\}@@ is linearly
> independent and therefore a basis for @@\FF_{p^n}@@.

I'll prove by contraposition. Suppose there were some constants @@\alpha_i \in
\FF_p@@, not all zero, such that
%%\begin{equation\*}
    \sum\_{i=0}^{n-1} \alpha_i g^i = 0.
\end{equation\*}%%
Then by definition @@g@@ satisfies this polynomial nonzero of degree at most
@@n-1@@, and its minimal polynomial must have degree less than or equal to that.
□

> *Theorem:* If @@g \in \FF_{p^n}@@ is primitive, then its minimal polynomial
> has degree at least (exactly) @@n@@.

Again, I'll proceed by contraposition. Without loss of generality, suppose @@g@@
satisfies some monic polynomial of degree @@d < n@@. We can move all the lower
degree terms to one side to get
%%\begin{equation\*}
    g^d = \sum\_{i=0}^{d-1} \alpha_i g^i.
\end{equation\*}%%
Then, all subsequent powers of @@g@@ can be expressed as a linear combination of
@@\\{1,g,g^2,\cdots,g^{d-1}\\}@@. Just keep substituting this identity until all
instances of @@g@@ have power at most @@d-1@@. Therefore, the set of elements
@@\langle g\rangle \subseteq \FF_{p^n}^\times@@ that can be reached via powers
of @@g@@ has at most @@p^d - 1@@ elements. We get @@p@@ choices for each
coefficient, minus one because zero can't be reached. This is strictly fewer
elements than are contained in the whole field, so @@g@@ cannot be primitive. □

> *Corollary:* If @@g \in \FF_{p^n}@@ is primitive, any @@n@@ consecutive powers
> of @@g@@ are linearly independent and therefore form a basis.

To show @@\\{1,g,g^2,\cdots,g^n\\}@@ is linearly independent, simply compose the
above theorem and the lemma before it. As for any @@n@@ consecutive powers, with
@@g^d@@ being the lowest power among them, linearly transform this basis via
multiplication with @@g^d@@. □


## Future Work

Characterizing powers of two and consecutive powers is relatively easy. However,
real-world situations might not afford this structure. Attackers might only be
able to choose bits at irregular positions, and the above guarantees about how
many choices are needed to span might not hold. Future work might focus on
getting a tighter bound on which and how many elements are needed to guarantee a
spanning set.

Additionally, I assumed for simplicity that the attacker would choose once per
byte --- either @@c@@ or @@d@@. They usually have more choices than that though,
and it would be good to take advantage of them. By introducing @@K@@ independent
displacement vectors @@\delta_k@@, it's possible to use an alphabet @@\Sigma@@
that has @@2^K@@ characters. In that case, you need to solve
%%\begin{align\*}
    x^{32} \cdot \sum\_{i=0}^{\ell-1}\sum_{k=1}^K \alpha_{i,k} \cdot x^{8i} \delta_k &= t - p \nl
    \sum\_{i=0}^{\ell-1}\sum_{k=1}^K \alpha_{i,k} \cdot x^{8i} \delta_k &= \frac{t - p}{x^{32}}.
\end{align\*}%%
Additionally, @@\Sigma@@ has to be an affine space over @@\FF_2@@, otherwise it
wouldn't be possible to safely take linear combinations of the vectors
@@\delta_k@@ as we require. Finally, while the bound on @@\ell@@ established
above still technically holds, in the case of multiple displacement vectors,
it's clearly very loose. Intuitively, we'd expect it to be close to
@@\frac{32}{K}@@. Future work could try to relax these restrictions and get a
tighter bound on the number of bytes needed.


## Worked Example

Suppose I want to find a string that starts with `DC`, only contains the letters
`G` and `T` after that, and whose CRC-32 is the same as the string `the`. I
compute the target CRC to be `0x3c456de6`, and undoing the post-processing by
reversing the bits and NOTing gives
%%\begin{align\*}
    t =&\,
        1 + x + x^6 + x^7 + x^8 \nl
        &+ x^{10} + x^{11} + x^{12} + x^{14} \nl
        &+ x^{16} + x^{19} + x^{22} \nl
        &+ x^{27} + x^{28} + x^{31}.
\end{align\*}%%
Taking @@\ell=32@@ gives the original message
`DCGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGGG`, and computing its CRC gives `0xbaab7c95`,
or
%%\begin{align\*}
    p =&\,
        x + x^5 + x^7 + x^9 + x^{11} \nl
        &+ x^{13} + x^{16} + x^{22} + x^{23} \nl
        &+ x^{25} + x^{26} + x^{28} + x^{30}.
\end{align\*}%%
This gives a difference of
%%\begin{align\*}
    t-p =&\,
        1 + x^5 + x^6 + x^8 + x^9 \nl
        &+ x^{10} + x^{12} + x^{13} + x^{14} \nl
        &+ x^{19} + x^{23} + x^{25} + x^{26} \nl
        &+ x^{27} + x^{30} + x^{31}.
\end{align\*}%%
The characters we can use have ASCII codes `0x47` and `0x54` respectively.
Remembering that the bytes will be reflected on the input, the polynomials are
%%\begin{align\*}
    c &= x + x^5 + x^6 + x^7 \nl
    d &= x + x^3 + x^5 \nl
    \delta &= x^3 + x^6 + x^7.
\end{align\*}%%
I then compute
%%\begin{align\*}
    \vect{y} =&\, \frac{t-p}{x^{32}\delta} \nl
        =&\, 1 + x + x^4 + x^6 + x^7 \nl
        &+ x^9 + x^{18} + x^{19} + x^{21} \nl
        &+ x^{22} + x^{24} + x^{25} + x^{26} \nl
        &+ x^{27} + x^{29} + x^{30}.
\end{align\*}%%
Solving gives
%%\begin{align\*}
    \vect{\alpha} = [\,\,
        &0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1, \nl
        &1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, \nl
        &0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, \nl
        &1, 1, 1, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0 \,\,],
\end{align\*}%%
which corresponds to the message `DCGGTTGTTTTTGTTTTGTGTTTTTTTTGGGTTG`. Remeber
that @@\vect{\alpha}[0]@@ corresponds to the last character of the string.

## Appendix: Previous Results

This section lists facts I used to prove my main results.

> *Lemma ([Conrad § 1.6][5]):* The multiplicative group @@F^\times@@ of a
> finite field @@F@@ is cyclic.

Remember that, over fields, polynomials can have at most as many roots as their
degree. If it has a root @@r@@, a factor of @@(X-r)@@ can be divided out. This
can be repeated until the polynomial is reduced to a constant. We can use that
fact to show the following: if @@F^\times@@ has at least one element of order
@@d@@, then it has exactly @@\varphi(d)@@ of them. Let @@g@@ be an element such
that @@g^d@@ is the lowest power of @@g@@ equaling the group identity @@1@@.
Every element @@X@@ in the group it generates @@\langle g\rangle@@ will satisfy
@@X^d - 1 = 0@@. There are @@d@@ such elements in this subgroup, so we've found
all the possible roots of that polynomial. To find objects in @@F^\times@@ of
order exactly @@d@@, it suffices to restrict our search to @@\langle g\rangle@@.
By basic number theory, out of the @@d@@ elements in that cycle with order
dividing @@d@@, exactly @@\varphi(d)@@ of them will have order exactly @@d@@.

Define @@\text{NumElementsOfOrder}(d)@@ to be the number of elements in
@@F^\times@@ such that their @@d@@-th power is their smallest power equaling
@@1@@. As discussed above, that function returns either @@\varphi(d)@@ or @@0@@.
Clearly, summing over all the values possible @@d@@ can take will give the size
of the group:
%%\begin{align\*}
    \|F^\times\|
        &= \sum\_{d \text{ dividing } \|F^\times\|} \text{NumElementsOfOrder}(d) \nl
        &\leq \sum\_{d \text{ dividing } \|F^\times\|} \varphi(d) \nl
        &\leq \|F^\times\|, \nl
\end{align\*}%%
with the last step deriving from [Gauss's formula][6]. Since the first sum
attains its maximum value, it must agree with the second sum on every term. In
particular, this means
%%\begin{align\*}
    \text{NumElementsOfOrder}(|F^\times|)
        &= \varphi(|F^\times|) \nl
        &\neq 0.
\end{align\*}%%
There is at least one element whose powers generate the whole group. □

This result isn't strictly needed, but remembering that the underlying group is
cyclic may make some of the later results more intuitive. Also, the methods used
are just cool, so I wanted to include it.

> *Lemma ([Freshman's Dream][4]):* Over a ring @@R@@ of prime characteristic
> @@p@@, any @@a,b \in R@@ satisfy @@(a+b)^p = a^p+b^p@@.

Simply expand via binomial theorem. All the "impure" terms drop out because
their coefficients are all multiples of @@p@@. Why? Remember that
%%\begin{align\*}
    \binom{p}{k}
        &= \frac{p!}{k! \cdot (p-k)!} \nl
        &= \frac{1}{k!} \cdot p \cdot (p-1) \cdots (p-k+1).
\end{align\*}%%
Since @@p@@ is prime, it's not possible for @@k!@@ to divide @@p@@ with @@k <
p@@. So, the factor remains, and @@\binom{p}{k}@@ is divisible by @@p@@. The
only places this argument breaks are when @@k=p@@ and @@k=0@@. In those cases,
@@\binom{p}{k}=1@@. Thus, over this ring where multiples of @@p@@ vanish, only
the first and last terms of the binomial expansion remain. □

> *Lemma ([Frobenius Endomorphism][8]):* Over the finite field @@\FF_{p^n}@@,
> the map @@X \mapsto X^p@@ is an automorphism --- an isomorphism from
> @@\FF_{p^n}@@ to itself.

It can easily be verified that both the additive and multiplicative identities
are fixed by the function @@X^p@@. In fact, [Fermat's Little Theorem][7] shows
that all of @@\FF_p@@ remains fixed. Freshman's Dream shows that this function
respects addition. Powers trivially respect multiplication, so @@X^p@@ is an
endomorphism --- a homorphism from @@\FF_{p^n}@@ to itself.

All that remains is to show that @@X^p@@ is injective and therefore bijective.
[This MathOverflow post][9] does that in one line, noting that @@\ker X^p =
\\{0\\}@@ since that's the only proper ideal in a finite field. In fact, the
same logic shows that any ring endomorphism over @@\FF_{p^n}@@ is an
automorphism.

I'll do it a different way though. Suppose for the sake of contradiction that
@@X^p@@ is not injective, so it maps two different elements of
@@\FF_{p^n}^\times@@ to the same thing. This is equivalent to saying that it
maps some @@g \neq 1@@ to the identity. That element @@g@@ satisfies @@X^p - 1 =
0@@, as do all the other elements of @@\langle g\rangle@@. Since that subgroup
has @@p@@ elements, we've found all solutions to @@X^p = 1@@, which is @@\ker
X^p@@ by definition. Recall that the size of a subgroup divides the size of the
whole group, so we get @@p@@ divides @@p^n-1@@, which is false. □
