Recently, I rediscovered a special case of [Baranyani's
Theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baranyai%27s_theorem). Specifically, that
of @@r=2@@, a result which has apparently been known since the 1800s. It states
that every complete graph with an even number of vertices @@n@@ has a proper
[edge coloring](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_coloring) with @@n-1@@
colors. Alternatively, it is possible to partition the edges of @@K_n@@ into
@@n-1@@ sets (colors) such that no two edges in the same set share an endpoint.
Clearly, this is the least possible number of colors --- each vertex has @@n-1@@
edges going out of it. The theorem states that, for even @@n@@, it is possible
to attain this minimum.

I actually discovered this fact in a context completely separate from graph
theory. This semester, I served as a TA for [CS
2110](/assets/2020/12/31/CS2110Syl.pdf) at Georgia Tech. It was fun, though time
consuming, and I thought a lot about how to best teach struggling students. I
remembered that pair programming is a common technique used to guide new
developers, but it could never be implemented in the course. Nonetheless, I went
on a tangent thinking about how one could implement pair programming in a class.
Ideally, the same students wouldn't work together all the time --- usually the
teacher would mix them around. How long it would take before we're forced to
repeat, and a student is paired with someone they've already worked with?

I assumed the number of students @@n@@ was even for simplicity. Each day, we
take @@\frac{1}{2}n@@ subsets of size two, making sure none of them share an
element. We also want to never repeat subsets. In that case, the longest we can
possibly sustain this process is clearly

%%
\frac{\text{# Total Subsets}}{\text{# Subsets per Day}}
= \frac{\binom{n}{2}}{\frac{1}{2}n}
= n-1
%%

days. I still had to show we can't be cut short, though, and that's what I set
out to do.

\{1,6\} \, \{2,3\} \, \{4,5\}
\end{align*}
%%

I started as I usually do, taking small examples and trying to find some
pattern. One of the first things I noticed was that a greedy algorithm wouldn't
always work. In the case above, for example, a greedy approach fails on the
second day (row). After taking @@\\{1,3\\}@@, the algorithm takes @@\\{2,4\\}@@
then is forced to repeat @@\\{5,6\\}@@. There might've been some ordering with
which this approach would work, and we see later that this is the case, but I
decided to look elsewhere.

Another pattern I noticed had to do with the first and last lines in the
arrangement above. It's not immediately obvious from the figure, so consider the
"re-arrangement" below.

%%
\begin{align\*}
\\{1,2\\} \, \\{3,4\\} \, \\{5,6\\} \nl
\\{2,3\\} \, \\{4,5\\} \, \\{1,6\\}
\end{align\*}
%%

The first row contains subsets of adjacent numbers starting at @@1@@ and going
up. The same is true for the last row, except it starts at @@2@@ (and wraps
around). Another way see this configuration is to start by taking the sets with
adjacent elements in the "natural" order --- @@\\{1,2\\}@@, @@\\{2,3\\}@@, all
the way up to @@\\{6,1\\}@@ --- then to place all these sets, alternating days
as we go. This was a nice observation, but I couldn't immediately elaborate on
it. I would later use it in a different form.

Most of my effort focused on looking for some recursive pattern --- some way to
create the case of @@n+2@@ from that of @@n@@. Initially, the problem would seem
to lend itself to induction. The structure above, with the subsets @@\\{1,x\\}@@
along the right side, looked convenient to work with, and I tried inducting with
that. I put the sets @@\\{1,2\\}@@ along the first @@n-3@@ rows, then worked to
"swap" the @@2@@ with some other number (in another set), using the remaining
@@2@@ rows to put the "destroyed" sets in. I spent a lot of time here, but never
quite got it to work.

\end{align*}

That's not to say I didn't make progress, though. One effective way I found to
think about this problem was to imagine each pair of students as a permutation,
specifically a two-cycle. Each day (row) is then a product of two-cycles, and
we're given the constraint that each column must be a permutation as well. This
reframing gives a nice table, which I find easier to think about.

An observation I made soon after was the existence of "three-cycles". In the
example above, we have the two-cycle @@\begin{pmatrix}1&2\end{pmatrix}@@ on day
one, and @@\begin{pmatrix}1&3\end{pmatrix}@@ on day two. This implies that
@@\begin{pmatrix}2&3\end{pmatrix}@@ cannot be on days one or two, and must be on
some other day (five in this case). I thought this could be made into some
algorithm to arrange the cycles with. But, I gave up on it after realizing how
much overlap there would be between different three-cycles. Again, I would see
this observation later in a different form.

Another observation arising from this framing, and one which I found quite
powerful, was the idea of "pointing". For example, in the above arrangement, the
@@1@@ on the first day is paired with @@2@@ --- the first column of the first
row has a @@2@@. So it can be seen as pointing to the @@2@@ (the second column)
on the *second* day. Similarly, the @@2@@ on the second day points to the @@5@@
on the *third* day, and so on until we cycle back to the first day. Repeatedly
following these pointers gives "paths", @@(1,2,5,3,6,1)@@ in this case. This
path is "bad" since it repeats a number. "Good" paths are aptly named since the
recursive construction from the last section, the one involving @@\\{1,x\\}@@
sets, can made to work with it. (More on this later.)

In the day-ordering given above, there is no good path starting with any of the
numbers. The days can be reordered to give favorable results, though.
Nonetheless, I couldn't prove that good orderings *always* exist, and in fact
they don't. While writing this post, I found that the configuration given above
is a counterexample. I know this because I wrote some code to check all possible
permutations of the days and starting locations.

I also tried shoe-horning new days into old ones, integrating into existing
paths regardless of whether they were good or bad, but I didn't make much
headway there either.

No, the real breakthrough came when I was studying for [MATH
3012](https://math.gatech.edu/courses/math/3012). A major part of the course was
graph theory. My notes on it were the longest out of all the units, with an
entire page devoted to definitions. Most of them were straightforward, but I
found the definition for edges peculiar. We defined an edge as a subset of size
two of the vertex set, at least in the simple and undirected case.

I had the insight to model each pair of students as an edge in a graph. Then,
I'd have to show that @@K_n@@ can be edge-colored with @@n-1@@ colors (for @@n@@
even). The different colors correspond to different days, and forcing the
minimum possible number of colors ensures noone is left out on any day --- we
need all @@\frac{1}{2}n@@ possible edges per color to meet the chromatic number
requirement.

The first thing I did was check if something like this was already known, which
of course [it was](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edge_coloring#Examples). I
chose not to look at the proof, though. I wanted to find it myself.

In retrospect, it should've been obvious that I was dealing with a graph
problem. The pattern I noticed with "adjacent subsets" --- @@\\{1,2\\}@@, then
@@\\{2,3\\}@@, all the way up to @@\\{6,1\\}@@ --- is simply that even cycles
can be two-colored. Specifically, I was looking at the cycle on the "rim" of
@@K_n@@, shown below. Similarly, the pattern I noticed with three-cycles is just
that triangles have chromatic number @@3@@.

![The rim of K_6, colored with two colors](/assets/2020/12/31/rim_coloring.svg)

Moreover, my idea with pointers is fundamentally a statement about graphs. A
good path is just a path in @@K_n@@ that traverses each of the @@n-1@@ colors
exactly once. Graphs with such a path can be used to (recursively) create an
edge-coloring for @@K_{n+2}@@ with @@(n+2)-1@@ colors. How?

First note that recoloring some of the old edges in @@K_n@@ with the two new
colors won't break its proper coloring, at least not inherently. As long as none
of the new colors' edges share a vertex, the resulting coloring will be proper.
Phrased differently, the only way to break a proper coloring by recoloring edges
is through the edges recolored.

With that in mind, we can take the good path @@P=(x_1,x_2,\cdots,x_n)@@ and
integrate it with the two new vertices @@u@@ and @@v@@. Consider the cycle
starting at @@u@@, then following the good path @@P@@, then ending at @@v@@
before cycling back. We'll color that even cycle with the two new colors @@c_n@@
and @@c_{n+1}@@. Without loss of generality, let the edges @@\\{u,x_1\\}@@ and
@@\\{x_n,v\\}@@ be colored with @@c_n@@. As for all the other new edges, color
@@\\{u,x_i\\}@@ the same color that @@\\{x_{i-1},x_i\\}@@ was before it was
overwritten, and similarly color @@\\{x_i,v\\}@@ whatever @@\\{x_i,x_{i+1}\\}@@
was. The diagram below might be helpful.

![An example of recursion with good paths](/assets/2020/12/31/good_path_recursion.svg)

Sadly, recursing in this way doesn't guarantee the existence of a good path in
the resulting graph. Like before, I made some effort to use this argument even
in the absence of good paths, but I didn't have much luck.

---

While working on that, I made some other observations that would be important.
But before that, I'd like to define some terms.

> A *day* is a set of @@\frac{1}{2}n@@ edges in @@K_n@@ not sharing any
> vertices.

I devoted a lot of time to finding days. Why? A coloring we're searching for can
be seen as a collection of @@n-1@@ different days that don't share any edges.
These days would encompass all @@\binom{n}{2}@@ possible edges, and thus provide
an @@n-1@@ edge coloring, with each day corresponding to a color. As a sidenote,
this term was borrowed from the original problem I was working on.

> The *length* of an edge is the distance between its two endpoints, only going
> along the rim of the graph.

I found this to be a useful notion. Often, it was helpful to consider only edges
between vertices an even or an odd number apart, especially when thinking of the
vertices as elements of @@(\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z})^+@@. (More on that later.) I
also found it useful to give special treatment to *midlines* --- edges of length
@@\frac{1}{2}n@@, particularly when thinking geometrically. Of course, it has
drawbacks. Edge length only makes sense when considering @@K_n@@ drawn out as a
regular polygon. The lengths @@\ell@@ and @@n-\ell@@ are the same since it
fundamentally works modulo @@n@@. But, I found the notion helpful despite its
caveats.

As for my observations, I first noticed that, for odd multiples of two, it's
possible to make days with a nice geometric structure. We can take a midline and
all the edges perpendicular to it to be in the same day. This one arrangement
generates @@\frac{1}{2}n@@ different days through @@180^\circ@@ rotational
symmetry, and encompasses all midlines and edges of even length. However, this
construction doesn't work when @@n@@ is an even multiple of two since it
contains two midlines instead of just one, leading to double counting. I tried
to make a similar construction for that case, sometimes trying to recurse down
by two as before, but to no avail.

<figure>
<img src="/assets/2020/12/31/midline_color.svg"/>
<figcaption>
    An example of the above construction when @@n=6@@.
</figcaption>
</figure>

Thankfully, I later noticed that I didn't need to worry about the even multiples
of two. Why? In that case, we can see @@K_n@@ as two different complete
@@K_{\frac{n}{2}}@@ graphs with vertices connected by a bipartite complete graph
@@K_{\frac{n}{2},\frac{n}{2}}@@. It's straightforward to edge-color the latter
with @@\frac{1}{2}n@@ colors. Moreover, since @@\frac{1}{2}n@@ is even by
assumption, we can recursively color the two @@K_{\frac{n}{2}}@@s with the
colors that remain.

Now, I was just left with coloring the edges of odd length, and this is where I
got stuck. I couldn't find a geometric way to color them for odd multiples of
two. For even multiples, I could take all the edges parallel to a given edge on
the rim, but I'd already decided to handle that case with recursion. Trying that
same strategy with odd multiples double counted midlines.

Separately from my geometric arguments, I had tried looking at the graph through
the lens of "number theory". Numbering all the vertices counterclockwise (or
clockwise) starting at zero gives something akin to @@\mathbb{Z}/n\mathbb{Z}@@.
I looked at cycles in that ring generated by multiplication and addition.
Multiplication wasn't that useful since it left out zero, but addition was. In
particular, I noticed that by fixing an odd number @@\ell@@, I could color all
edges of length @@\ell@@ with just two colors. Why? Since @@n@@ is even but
@@\ell@@ is odd, the cycle @@\langle\ell\rangle@@ generated by @@\ell@@ will
have an even number of elements, and even cycles can be two colored. Note that
@@\langle\ell\rangle@@ may have multiple cosets, but they're all disjoint, so
their edges can reuse the same two colors.

This essentially solved my problem of coloring edges of odd length. There are
only @@\frac{1}{4}n-\frac{1}{2}@@ possible values @@\ell@@ can take. We'll thus
use @@\frac{1}{2}n-1@@ colors for the edges of odd length, plus the
@@\frac{1}{2}n@@ for the midlines and edges of even length, giving @@n-1@@
colors total. Of course, I didn't realize this at the time. Instead, I tried to
find a number theoretic approach to coloring the edges of even length, again to
no avail. I only realized my geometric and number theoretic approaches could be
combined when I saw some of the pretty pictures generated by the latter, such as
the one below.

<figure>

    length @@\ell=3@@, and only shows one of the colors
</figcaption>
</figure>

---

So then, my path was clear. I'd first recurse down to an odd multiple of two,
then use my geometric approch to color all the midlines and edges of even
length, and finally use my number theoretic approach to color the remaining
edges. I wrote a Python program to do this and tested my algorithm all the way
up to @@K_{500}@@. I also wrote some SageMath code to display the results. It's
not efficient in the slightest, and it's not even the best algorithm to do this,
but it gets the job done.

And so, I'd finished about a month of work. My last two posts have been quite
long. I plan to only do that when it comes naturally, and not to force myself to
wrote long-form content if I don't have any. Besides that, I enjoyed
rediscovering this theorem, or rather a special case of it. I find solved
problems a good source of puzzles. They're quite challenging, but still within
the realm of a student's understanding. That's why I do them.
