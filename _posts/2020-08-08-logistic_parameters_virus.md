Recently, I've been working on invent**summer**, a part of
[inventXYZ](https://inventxyz.com). It's run by my friend and some of his
classmates, and I highly suggest checking them out - they're doing great things.
Either way, given this was written when the Coronavirus outbreak was happening,
it's unsurprising that one of the projects in invent**summer** revolved around
it. Specifically, we were guided through building a stochastic simulator for
modeling the spread of a virus in a city. The model itself was very simple, but
it still showed some important features of virus transmission.

In particular, the curve of the total number of affected people to date
resembled a logistic curve. However, it's highly unlikely the curve was actually
logistic. For instance, it seemed new cases only formed at the boundary of the
"blob" of current cases. This is especially aparent toward the end of the
spread, where the boundary was just the "frontier" between the top and bottom
sides of the arena. One can imagine this playing out in an arena that is much
taller than it is wide. There, cases would grow linearly, not logistically, for
most of the spread.

As you may have guessed, I've recently been interested in modelling the spread
of viruses, at least with many simplifying assumptions in place. Specifically,
I'd like to fit differential equations to the spread, mainly because I know they
can and have been used to model stochastic processes like
[Browinian Motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion). I've done
some work on a model similar to invent**summer**'s, and I may blog my work when
it's more complete. For now, though, I'd like to write about a much simpler
case.

I assumed that we had a total population size of @@K@@ and denoted the current
number of infected people as @@k \leq K@@. I further said that every infected
person had some probability @@P_I@@ of infecting a given healthy person in the
next second. Note that, once a person was infected, they remained so for the
duration of the spread - there was no recovery. Also see that I completely
ignored individual differences in @@P_I@@ - I said that it's the same for every
pair of infected and healthy people, regardless of how much prior contact
they've had.

Those assumptions, though extremely limiting, allow us to solve explicitly.
Using the common probability "trick" for the union of independent events and
assuming that our numbers are large enough for probabilities to be treated as
proportions, we see that the average rate of increase in the infected population
will be
%% \frac{\text{d}k}{\text{d}t} = \left(1-(1-P_I)^k\right)\cdot(K-k) . %%
This can intuitively be arrived at by assuming @@k@@ doesn't change much over
the next second and computing what the effect would be. Of course, @@k@@ does
change over the couse of that second, so our computation would only be the rate
of change at that instant - the derivative with respect to time.

The above differential equation doesn't seem to be solvable with elementary
methods. But, just as we can approximate @@\sin x \approx x@@ for small values
of @@x@@, we can also apply a first order approximation to the function
%%\begin{align\*}
(1-P_I)^k &= \exp(\ln(1-P_I)\,k) \nl
    &\approx 1 + \ln(1-P_I)\,k \nl
1 - (1-P_I)^k &\approx -\ln(1-P_I)\cdot k .
\end{align\*}%%
Thus, for sufficiently small @@P_I@@, we get
%% \frac{\text{d}k}{\text{d}t} = -\ln(1-P_I)\cdot k\cdot(K-k), %%
the classic logistic differential equation.

*Note that the logic in the above few paragraphs is slightly more nuanced than
what I present. Indeed, this creates some issues for me later on. See if you can
spot the issue before I get to it.*

Of course, this all works in theory, but what about in practice? To test, I
wrote a very simple Python script to simulate forward stochastically and compare
with the predicted results. The code is basically what you'd expect, so I won't
include a listing here, and I'll just link to it at the end of this post. The
only slightly complicated part involves computing the probability @@P_i@@ of a
given infected person infecting a fixed healthy person *in one timestep* instead
of in one second. To do this, we again apply the probability "trick" for the
union of independent events to get
%%\begin{align\*}
P_I &= 1 - (1-P_i)^\frac{1}{\text{d}t} \nl
P_i &= 1 - (1-P_I)^{\text{d}t},
\end{align\*}%%
assuming we're using natural units so @@\text{d}t@@ is in seconds.

![A plot of the the growth](/assets/2020/08/08/growth.png) Overall, the plot
came out quite nicely. The simulation was run for @@10\,\text{seconds}@@ with:
* @@\texttt{POP_SIZE} = K = 10^6@@,
* @@\texttt{P_INFECT} = P_I = 10^{-6}@@,
* @@\texttt{DT} = \text{d}t = 10^{-2}\,\text{seconds}@@, and
* @@\texttt{PROP_INITIAL_INFECTED} = 1\%@@ of the initial population infected.

The orange curve is the expected number of infected people at a given time, and
the blue curve is the actual number. Note that the former is an overshoot of the
latter in the above image. At first, I thought this was random variation, but it
was actually fairly consistent behavior. However, decreasing @@\text{d}t@@ fixed
this issue.

Having confirmed my model in a nominal case, I wanted to see what happened when
I violated the assumption that @@P_I@@ was small. Plotting the change in the
number of infected people versus the total number infected, we'd expect a slow
but present divergence from the "ideal" parabola. I decided for no particular
reason to set @@P_I = 75\%@@, which would give the plot below, where the dotted
line is the "ideal" parabola and the solid line is the "actual" curve.

Of course, just cranking up @@P_I@@ didn't exactly yield the best results.
Combining that, with the fact I kept the population size high to minimize random
artifacts, meant that everyone got infected almost immediately. Remember that,
in my model, everyone is "on top of each other." To compensate for this, I
reduced the total simulation time to @@10^{-5}\,\text{seconds}@@. I also reduced
@@\text{d}t@@ to not lose resolution, but I didn't want to set it so low that
we introduce too many random artifacts into the plot of the derivative. After
some trial and error, I set @@\text{d}t = 2.5\cdot 10^{-9}\, \text{seconds}@@.

![The result](/assets/2020/08/08/dk.png)
The above image was the result of my experiment. The orange curve is the "ideal"
parabola, and the blue points are the actual data I collected. I was surprised
to see no loss in accuracy due to my "small-probability approximation," and it
turns out that's because of the nuance in my reasoning I mentioned earlier. It
seems that it's best to assume that @@k@@ only remains (relatively) constant
over the course of a single timestep. Over that step,
%%\begin{align\*}
\text{d}k &= \left(1 - (1-P_i)^k\right)\cdot(K-k) \nl
    &= \left(1 - \left(1-\left(1-(1-P_I)^{\text{d}t}\right)\right)^k\right)\cdot(K-k) \nl
    &= \left(1 - (1-P_I)^{k\,\text{d}t}\right)\cdot(K-k),
\end{align\*}%%
where we just substituted in what we got earlier for @@P_i@@ and did some
algebra. Now, we can assume that @@k\,\text{d}t \leq K\,\text{d}t@@ is small (as
it will be in the limiting case), and expand to the first order as
%%\begin{align\*}
\text{d}k &= -\ln(1-P_I)\,k\,\text{d}t\cdot(K-k) \nl
\frac{\text{d}k}{\text{d}t} &= -\ln(1-P_I)\cdot k\cdot(K-k).
\end{align\*}%%
It's the same result, just different reasoning and weaker requirements.

That basically wraps up my exploration with this simplified model. There are
many situations where it starts to break. I already pointed out one at the start
of this post, but another one would be where @@\text{d}t@@ is large. Consider a
scenario where people go to the supermarket once a week but otherwise isolate.
In that case, the actual growth would be much less than what this model would
predict just given the probability of transmission.

Nonetheless, it makes sense that we see logistic-like growth in all kinds of
virus spread. Not only does the basic logic - that new cases come from old cases
and that the growth will cap at some point - hold, but we might also be able to
compute then use an average @@P_I@@ for the population. Indeed, in real life, we
do compute a population-wide average for
%% R_0 \approx \frac{1}{1-P_I}, %%
even though individual @@R_0@@s can vary wildly. It seems this simple logistic
model is more versatile than I give it credit for.
